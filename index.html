  <h2>About me &#9997</h2>
  <p>
    Gregg Charles Popovich (born January 28, 1949) is an American professional basketball coach and executive who is the president and head coach of the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Taking over as coach of the Spurs in 1996, Popovich is the longest tenured active coach in the NBA as well as all other major sports leagues in the United States. He is often called "Coach Pop" or simply "Pop".
    He is the winningest coach in NBA history, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest coaches in NBA history.
    Popovich led the Spurs to a winning record in his first 22 full seasons as head coach, surpassing Phil Jackson for the most consecutive winning seasons in NBA history.
     During his tenure, the Spurs have had a winning record against every other NBA team.
     Popovich has led the Spurs to all five of their NBA titles, and is one of only five coaches in NBA history to have won five titles.
      He was also the head coach of the U.S. national team at the 2020 Summer Olympics, leading the team to a gold medal.
      Popovich was married to Erin Popovich until her death on April 18, 2018; the couple had two children. He is a serious wine collector, and an investor in Oregon's A to Z Wineworks.
      On multiple occasions, Popovich has spoken out on behalf of social justice issues, including in support of the 2017 Women's March. 
      He also repeatedly criticized the behavior of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Popovich endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.
      Popovich has spent considerable time and money working with several charities and nonprofits such as the San Antonio Food Bank and the Innocence Project.
     He also took part in Shoes That Fit, an organization that aims to deliver shoes to more than 200 students at Gates Elementary School affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
     Popovich is helping raise funds for J/P HRO, a disaster relief program that operates in Haiti, and various disaster relief organizations in the U.S. and Caribbean.
